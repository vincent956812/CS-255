# CS-255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client?
What type of system did they want you to design?
The owner of DriverPass wants to design a website for training
drivers. The owner thinks that students are not receiving
proper training for driving and that is why there are so many
out there that are failing.
The client is the owner of Driver Pass and he wants the system
built for student drivers to register for a driving course training.
The type of system they want us to design is one where the
users can create their own accounts and select driving
packages they want. The users will be able to get online
training, take online exams and then get on the road training
as well. The owner will have access to all the accounts of the
students and the employees.
 What did you do particularly well?
I think I worked on the designing requirements of this system
well. The designing requirements are a very critical step to
creating this software and it took a lot of precise work.
 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents
to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would work on the functional and non-functional requirements
because it is a very critical part of the project and with projects
changing over time this part of the project is never really
complete. I would like to be able to make it a little more stable
so it is not ever changing. I would improve this by getting
students and employers feedback. Feedback from the clients
that are using the software can be the most helpful.
 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them
into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the
user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to make sure I broke down all the requirements that
were being asked of us. I wanted to make sure I got each piece
of each part (the client, the student, the owner and the
employees) of the requirements separate which made it easier
to work with.
The client’s requirements are so important because without the
proper requirements the project will not be useful to them.
Basically without the requirements we could not complete the
project.
 How do you approach designing software? What techniques or
strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a
system?
In designing the software I would first want to get the
requirements of the new functionalities of the system. Then I
would design the system and add the new features.
To future analyze I would want to get feedback. Once I had the
feedback I would want to consider the system constraints.
From there I could work on doing any fixes/changes that could
help the system work.
